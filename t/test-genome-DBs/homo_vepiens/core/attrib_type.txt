The method relies on the primary data that can support full-length transcript structure and data are provided by UCSC.  The following categories are assigned to each of the evaluated annotations. tsl1 - all splice junctions of the transcript are supported by at least one non-suspect mRNA. tsl2 - the best supporting mRNA is flagged as suspect or the support is from multiple ESTs. tsl3 - the only support is from a single EST. tsl4 - the best supporting EST is flagged as suspect. tsl5 - no single transcript supports the model structure. tslNA - the transcript was not analyzed for one of the following reasons: pseudogene annotation, including transcribed pseudogenes.Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transcript. Immunoglobin gene transcript.  T-cell receptor transcript. Single-exon transcript (will be included in a future version)

450	rseq_mrna_match	RefSeq model genomic seq to mRNA match	This is a transcript attribute that signifies an exact match between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from (based on a match between the transcript stable id and an accession in the RefSeq mRNA file). An exact match occurs when the underlying genomic sequence of the model can be perfectly aligned to the mRNA sequence post polyA clipping.
451	rseq_mrna_nonmatch	RefSeq model genomic seq to mRNA non-match	This is a transcript attribute that signifies a non-match between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from. A non-match is deemed to have occurred if the underlying genomic sequence does not have a perfect alignment to the mRNA sequence post polyA clipping. It can also signify that no comparison was possible as the model stable id may not have had a corresponding entry in the RefSeq mRNA file (sometimes happens when accessions are retired or changed). When a non-match occurs one or several of the following transcript attributes will also be present to provide more detail on the nature of the non-match: rseq_5p_mismatch, rseq_cds_mismatch, rseq_3p_mismatch, rseq_nctran_mismatch, rseq_no_comparison
452	rseq_5p_mismatch	RefSeq model genomic seq (5' UTR) to mRNA mismatch	This is a transcript attribute that signifies a mismatch between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from. Specifically, there is a mismatch in the 5' UTR of the RefSeq model. Information about the mismatch can be found in the value field of the transcript attribute.
453	rseq_cds_mismatch	RefSeq model genomic seq (CDS) to mRNA mismatch	This is a transcript attribute that signifies a mismatch between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from. Specifically, there is a mismatch in the CDS of the RefSeq model. Information about the mismatch can be found in the value field of the transcript attribute.
454	rseq_3p_mismatch	RefSeq model genomic seq (3' UTR) to mRNA mismatch	This is a transcript attribute that signifies a mismatch between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from. Specifically, there is a mismatch in the 3' UTR of the RefSeq model. Information about the mismatch can be found in the value field of the transcript attribute.
455	rseq_nctran_mismatch	RefSeq model genomic seq (non-coding) to mRNA mismatch	This is a transcript attribute that signifies a mismatch between the underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq transcript with the corresponding RefSeq mRNA sequence the model was built from. This is a comparison between the entire underlying genomic sequence of the RefSeq model to the mRNA in the case of RefSeq models that are non-coding. Information about the mismatch can be found in the value field of the transcript attribute.
456	rseq_no_comparison	RefSeq model no comparison made to mRNA	This is a transcript attribute that signifies that no alignment was carried out between the underlying genomic sequence of RefSeq model and a corresponding RefSeq mRNA. The reason for this is generally that no corresponding, unversioned accession was found in the RefSeq mRNA file for the transcript stable id. This sometimes happens when accessions are retired or replaced. A second possibility is that the sequences were too long and problematic to align (though this is rare). The value field gives more information about the reason no comparison was possible.
457	rseq_ens_match_wt	RefSeq model to overlapping Ensembl model whole transcript match	This is a transcript attribute that signifies that for the RefSeq transcript there is an overlapping Ensembl model that is identical across the whole transcript. A whole transcript match is defined as follows: 1) In the case that both models are coding, the transcript, CDS and peptide sequences are all identical and the genomic coordinates of every exon match. 2) In the case that both transcripts are non-coding the transcript sequences and the genomic coordinates of every exon are identical. No comparison is made between a coding and a non-coding transcript. Useful related attributes are: rseq_ens_match_cds and rseq_ens_no_match.
458	rseq_ens_match_cds	RefSeq model to overlapping Ensembl model CDS match	This is a transcript attribute that signifies that for the RefSeq transcript there is an overlapping Ensembl model that is identical across the CDS region only. A CDS match is defined as follows: the CDS and peptide sequences are identical and the genomic coordinates of every translatable exon match. Useful related attributes are: rseq_ens_match_wt and rseq_ens_no_match.
459	rseq_ens_no_match	RefSeq model to overlapping Ensembl model no match	This is a transcript attribute that signifies that for the RefSeq transcript there is no overlapping Ensembl model that is identical across either the whole transcript or the CDS. This is caused by differences between the transcript, CDS or peptide sequences or between the exon genomic coordinates. Useful related attributes are: rseq_ens_match_wt and rseq_ens_match_cds.
468	ccds_transcript	CCDS transcript	This attribute signifies that a transcript has a matching CCDS transcript (the accession of which will be in the value column of the transcript_attrib entry). A match occurs when the genomic coordinates of all coding exons of the transcript are identical to the genomic coordinate of all coding exons in the overlapping CCDS model.
